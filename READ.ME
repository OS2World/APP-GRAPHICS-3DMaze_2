     This OS/2 2.0 Presentation Manager program generates mazes and prints
them in three dimensions.  It demonstrates device independent printing and
should work with any dot matrix or laser printer supported by OS/2 2.0.  Be
patient!  Not only is this program a number cruncher, but after a maze is
generated, the operating system must convert the metafile for the maze into a
printer image.  IBM C Set/2 source is included.
